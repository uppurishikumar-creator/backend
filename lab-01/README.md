## 🎯 Objective

Establish a robust Node.js backend environment from the ground up. Understand the single-threaded event loop architecture of the V8 JavaScript engine, construct foundational web servers using both the built-in Node.js `http` module and the lightweight **Express.js** framework, configure declarative REST route handlers (`/`, `/about`, `/time`), implement proper HTTP status codes (`200 OK`, `404 Not Found`), and configure **Nodemon** for automated hot-reloading during development.

## 🔌 Server Architecture & Routing Lifecycle

The Express application is constructed in [`server.js`](server.js):

1. **Instance Instantiation:** Initializes the Express application instance via `const app = express()`.
2. **Deterministic Route Ordering:** 
   - Express matches requests sequentially from top to bottom.
   - Specific route endpoints (`/`, `/about`, `/time`) are declared first.
3. **Catch-All 404 Middleware:**
   - Appended at the end of the routing stack using `app.use((request, response) => { ... })`.
   - Any request that fails to match a defined endpoint falls through to this handler, ensuring consistent `404 Not Found` responses.
4. **Listener Binding:** 
   - Binds to port `3000` via `app.listen(3000)`.

## ❗ Notes: Problems Faced and Solutions

| # | Challenge / Issue | Root Cause | Diagnosis & Resolution |
|:---:|---|---|---|
| **1** | **Port Conflict (`EADDRINUSE`)** | An existing background Node.js process was holding port `3000`. | Terminated the lingering process using PowerShell (`Stop-Process -Name node -Force`) or Task Manager before relaunching Nodemon. |
| **2** | **404 Catch-All Precedence** | Placing `app.use((req, res) => ...)` before specific `app.get()` routes intercepted and blocked all subsequent endpoints. | Repositioned the catch-all middleware to the very bottom of `server.js` so it executes only if no earlier routes match. |
| **3** | **Manual Server Restarts** | Plain Node runtime required stopping and restarting the server on every source code edit. | Configured `nodemon` as a development dependency in `package.json` with a dedicated `"dev": "nodemon server.js"` script for hot reloading. |
| **4** | **Content-Type Serialization** | Discrepancy between text responses and JSON payloads. | Utilized Express's smart serialization in `response.send()`: strings are automatically sent with `text/html; charset=utf-8`, while JS objects are formatted as `application/json`. |

## 🎓 Viva Voce Questions & Answers

| # | Question | Comprehensive Answer |
|:---:|---|---|
| **1** | **What is Node.js and how does its single-threaded event loop work?** | Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine. It uses an **event-driven, non-blocking I/O model**. Although JavaScript executes on a single main thread, long-running operations (file system, network I/O) are offloaded to background worker threads via the **libuv** library. Once completed, callbacks are queued into the event loop and executed on the main thread without blocking incoming traffic. |
| **2** | **What is the difference between Node's built-in `http` module and Express.js?** | The built-in `http` module (`http.createServer()`) provides low-level networking primitives where routing, URL parsing, request body chunks, MIME headers, and query strings must be parsed manually. **Express.js** is a higher-level abstraction that provides declarative routing (`app.get`, `app.post`), built-in middleware support (`express.json()`), convenience response helpers (`res.send()`, `res.json()`, `res.status()`), and scalable architectural patterns. |
| **3** | **What is Express middleware and why is route ordering critical?** | Middleware functions have access to the `request`, `response`, and `next` objects in the application lifecycle. They can execute code, modify request/response objects, end the cycle, or call `next()`. Route ordering is critical because Express executes middleware and routes strictly in the order they are registered. Placing a catch-all 404 handler at the top would block all subsequent routes. |
| **4** | **What is the difference between `package.json` and `package-lock.json`?** | `package.json` defines project metadata, scripts, and semantic version ranges (e.g. `^5.1.0`) for dependencies. `package-lock.json` records the exact, deterministic dependency tree (exact versions, resolved URLs, and integrity cryptographic hashes) installed at that moment, ensuring identical installs across different machines and environments. |
| **5** | **Why should Nodemon only be used in development rather than production?** | Nodemon continuously watches the filesystem and consumes extra memory and CPU resources to monitor directory changes. In production, code does not change on the fly; servers should be run using standard `node` and managed by process supervisors (such as PM2, Docker, or systemd) that optimize for memory stability, performance, and automated crash restarts. |

## 📜 Core Rules & Academic Integrity

- **Environment & Dependency Safety:** `node_modules/` is strictly excluded from version control via `.gitignore`.
- **HTTP Semantics:** Every route returns semantically accurate HTTP status codes (`200 OK`, `404 Not Found`).
- **Clean Architecture:** Modular separation of dependencies, scripts, and route handlers.
- **Originality:** Code and documentation are authored and maintained by the student.

---

## ✅ Conclusion

Through **Lab 1**, I achieved the following learning outcomes:
1. Initialized a Node.js project and managed dependencies using `npm`.
2. Built an asynchronous HTTP server using both standard Node primitives and Express.js.
3. Implemented clean, modular route handlers returning text, JSON, and dynamic timestamp data.
4. Designed a global 404 fallback mechanism to handle unrecognized endpoints gracefully.
5. Configured Nodemon for an efficient, hot-reloading development workflow.
